Eadicicco notes that investors are primarily focused on the likely iPhone 16 product line-up, which is expected to be the ""star of the show."" However, according to a Bloomberg report, Apple is also set to unveil three new Apple Watch models and updated AirPods. ""I think the big question on everybody's mind is gonna be how does Apple Intelligence play into all of this,"" Eadicicco states. She points out that some anticipated features include AI-powered text rewriting and email summarization, as well as an enhanced version of Siri tailored to individual users. Regarding Apple's AI integration, Eadicicco told Yahoo Finance, ""I think Apple's approach, based on what we've seen, is more contextual, it's more about kind of connecting the dots between the different apps on your phone and kind of using Siri as a way to do that.""

Jason Browne, Alexis Investment Partners president, joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss how recent volatility could be an opportunity to buy into tech. “We have a lot of negative news hitting simultaneous[ly] to the pullback. If we can look at those as opportunities to add to things that we may have missed out on or maybe underweight in that tends to work out well over time. The other thing to note is with tech, particularly [when] we're going into an environment that potentially is going to be continued growth but slower growth. Then names with very attractive balance sheets that are more consistent earners or earnings growers and so forth. They tend to be a place that people flock to,” Browne tells the Market Domination team. He adds, “We are seeing this last couple of months consolidation period in this very strong uptrend, as overall a positive thing. We had lightened up on growth leading into this mostly because of wanting, like many, to take advantage of the broadening leadership associated with a more sustained rally. But we've been buying the dip in tech periodically in each of these pullbacks.” The portfolio manager mentions Alexis Investment Partners “used more indirect exposure than direct buying,” with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) “that have significant weighting to these names.” He names iShares Global 100 ETF (IOO.MX) and Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) as ways to play tech. Browne notes that the ETFs were ""within the context of also adding to things like"" [real estate investment trusts] REITs and the equal-weight S&P 500 (^SPXEW). ""I was kind of buying the dip today in general, but I specifically did make sure to incorporate some of these broadly diversified funds that are heavily weighted to large-cap tech as a big chunk.” Browne also has focused on ""standouts within leading sectors."" He says ""Within technology, we own, as you might imagine, Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), in addition to owning a semiconductor ETF.""

Munson tells Yahoo Finance that Berkshire's growing cash pile reflects Warren Buffett's strategy to sell high, saying, ""I think you're going to have to see a market that trades much lower in valuation before you get him to do anything. And if he does anything that's not in a market that's getting crushed in its valuation, I think it's because he's going to look at things that he knows best or that are doing best and that's going to be in energy or in some of these industrial aerospace things that have been working well.""

Creative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the balancing act Apple needs to perform in building excitement around Apple Intelligence to drive upgrades while not overpromising and disappointing users. Bajarin talks about the ""unpredictability"" that Apple Intelligence presents for Apple and investors trying to gauge how the tech could drive an upgrade cycle. ""It's been hard to look back on the history of a couple [of] decades of consumer electronics and really see software itself drive a hardware cycle. It's typically been very hardware-driven, and I think that's the hardest comp that many of us are having to make is to really look at how much of a software angle is actually going to drive a hardware cycle when.... that's not really a comp that we've had before."" ""I think Apple Intelligence is the most mature kind of consumer AI implementation at a system level for customers,"" he says, but notes that ""Apple's now got to go market and tell that message and make it clear to consumers why are they going to want to use these features."" The analyst says while Apple is ""in a unique position to onboard and help mature experiences with this software,"" he worries ""that people are coming from either too high of expectations or really no expectations at all because it's not really a driver for them to go and want to use these devices.""

While Apple's Greater China sales also fell below estimates, the tech giant blew past iPhone sales estimates, posting $46.22 billion against estimates of $45.04 billion. To speak more about Apple's latest earnings print and its position in the Magnificent Seven, Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Seana Smith on Catalysts. ""It looks to be a very slow developing supercycle for AI inspired upgrades for the iPhone. And the reason I say that is they had 5.5% growth in iPhone revenue in the September quarter, and they're guiding to total company revenue growth of low single-digit,"" Forte says. ""So I think the two noisy points in the data are that China macroeconomic weakness — China's about 15% of revenue — I think that's making it hard to determine if we're seeing a supercycle and the other is that there was a mismatch in the timing"" of the iPhone 16 launch and the later Apple Intelligence software update. Forte denotes the delay in the release of Apple's AI features for the new iPhone model could be a ""real risk"" to Apple's consumer upgrade cycle. Forte also weighs in on Apple's guidance and why he's still seeing Amazon (AMZN) as a top Big Tech pick.

The senior equity research analyst sees several factors driving the market darlings higher into the end of the year, ranging from expectations about loosened regulation from the incoming Trump administration to increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by the US government. The analyst also sees the tech sector gaining by 20% through 2025. ""It's about the multiplier — for every dollar spent on Nvidia chip, there's an $8 to $10 multiplier across tech, across software, infrastructure, cybersecurity. That's why this is going to be a tech bull market that rages into next year,"" Ives explains to Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith. ""Because now it's about the second [or] fourth-derivative. Because now software they're they're on the dance floor at the AI party, they're no longer waiting behind the velvet rope. And now other tech players are trying to get in cybersecurity infrastructure."" Ives also comments on Palantir's (PLTR) position in the so-called AI revolution, speculating that the company has the potential to the next Oracle (ORCL).
