""You have a lot of bears [that have] been on the sidelines. They're going to have to commit capital toward the end of the year. Otherwise, the index is going to be way ahead of them. So again, I just say that sometimes we lose sight. We have to come back [and] see where we are, and there's a really strong tailwind despite who wins."" He highlights, ""Our favorites are still the market leaders"" like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). ""That's the way we've been playing this right now is some of your best stocks you like with the added volatility. Make volatility your friend, not your foe.

Creative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the balancing act Apple needs to perform in building excitement around Apple Intelligence to drive upgrades while not overpromising and disappointing users. Bajarin talks about the ""unpredictability"" that Apple Intelligence presents for Apple and investors trying to gauge how the tech could drive an upgrade cycle. ""It's been hard to look back on the history of a couple [of] decades of consumer electronics and really see software itself drive a hardware cycle. It's typically been very hardware-driven, and I think that's the hardest comp that many of us are having to make is to really look at how much of a software angle is actually going to drive a hardware cycle when.... that's not really a comp that we've had before."" ""I think Apple Intelligence is the most mature kind of consumer AI implementation at a system level for customers,"" he says, but notes that ""Apple's now got to go market and tell that message and make it clear to consumers why are they going to want to use these features."" The analyst says while Apple is ""in a unique position to onboard and help mature experiences with this software,"" he worries ""that people are coming from either too high of expectations or really no expectations at all because it's not really a driver for them to go and want to use these devices.""

While Apple's Greater China sales also fell below estimates, the tech giant blew past iPhone sales estimates, posting $46.22 billion against estimates of $45.04 billion. To speak more about Apple's latest earnings print and its position in the Magnificent Seven, Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Seana Smith on Catalysts. ""It looks to be a very slow developing supercycle for AI inspired upgrades for the iPhone. And the reason I say that is they had 5.5% growth in iPhone revenue in the September quarter, and they're guiding to total company revenue growth of low single-digit,"" Forte says. ""So I think the two noisy points in the data are that China macroeconomic weakness — China's about 15% of revenue — I think that's making it hard to determine if we're seeing a supercycle and the other is that there was a mismatch in the timing"" of the iPhone 16 launch and the later Apple Intelligence software update. Forte denotes the delay in the release of Apple's AI features for the new iPhone model could be a ""real risk"" to Apple's consumer upgrade cycle. Forte also weighs in on Apple's guidance and why he's still seeing Amazon (AMZN) as a top Big Tech pick.

The senior equity research analyst sees several factors driving the market darlings higher into the end of the year, ranging from expectations about loosened regulation from the incoming Trump administration to increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by the US government. The analyst also sees the tech sector gaining by 20% through 2025. ""It's about the multiplier — for every dollar spent on Nvidia chip, there's an $8 to $10 multiplier across tech, across software, infrastructure, cybersecurity. That's why this is going to be a tech bull market that rages into next year,"" Ives explains to Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith. ""Because now it's about the second [or] fourth-derivative. Because now software they're they're on the dance floor at the AI party, they're no longer waiting behind the velvet rope. And now other tech players are trying to get in cybersecurity infrastructure."" Ives also comments on Palantir's (PLTR) position in the so-called AI revolution, speculating that the company has the potential to the next Oracle (ORCL).
