The services sector expanded in August, according to the latest ISM Services PMI data. The reading was 51.5, just slightly higher than Wall Street's expectation and July's reading of 51.4. Meanwhile, 99,000 private payroll jobs were added to the US labor market in August, according to ADP. This figure came in well below original forecasts of 145,000 jobs. Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods emphasizes the importance of economic data leading into the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting in two weeks. As the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release August jobs data on Friday, Woods calls the print ""the biggest unemployment report we've had since the last one, obviously, which came two days after the Fed meeting."" It's been a rocky week for the auto industry as General Motors (GM) was downgraded by Wolfe Research, Volkswagen (VOW3.DE, VWAGY, VOW.DE, VWAPY) is considering shuttering some of its plants, and Tesla (TSLA) announced plans to release its Full Self-Driving technology in China and Europe in the first quarter of 2025. Autoblog editor-in-chief Greg Migliore explains that amid the wave of negative news for the industry, Tesla was rewarded for not making any drastic moves. Tuesday marked one of the biggest sales of high-grade corporate bonds, amounting to $43.3 billion. S&P Global Ratings global head of private markets analytics Ruth Yang joins the Catalysts team in-studio to discuss the credit market outlook as the Federal Reserve begins its rate easing cycle. ""We're looking for the rates to drop by about 150 basis points over the next 15 months. So the world is kind of starting to say, 'OK, we've got inflation under control. Things are getting better.

For eight years, Musk has teased the vision of a shared fleet of fully-autonomous Teslas, with the promise of that technology contributing significantly to the company’s valuation. The long-anticipated launch comes amid increased scrutiny about the promise of self-driving technology. While Google’s Waymo has logged more than 22 million rider miles with few incidents in select cities, accidents involving GM’s Cruise and Tesla’s autopilot technology have raised questions about the technology’s ability to scale safely. Amazon’s Zoox is providing a potential template for the future, building vehicles for the sole purpose of ferrying passengers autonomously, without the traditional controls like a steering wheel and pedals. The company says that their new technology will ensure cost efficiency and safety. Founder Jesse Levinson said that Zoox’s robotaxi is fundamentally different from Tesla’s driver assistance system, as Tesla vehicles require drivers to be ready to take control at any moment.  While Zoox doesn’t rely on human drivers for assistance, the company does use remote operators to guide the vehicle in rare situations.  “The vehicles are only getting help from humans only 1% of the time,” Levinson said. “As it gets more sophisticated, the amount of time they’re asking for help goes down.”  Still, critics question the economics and safety of self-driving taxis, noting that current autonomous rides are more expensive than car ownership, despite being cheaper than traditional rides. While Tesla investors are optimistic about robotaxis, experts believe substantial revenue is still years away.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=75db0a4205b0a7ce152b2b15f725874ddfda2616a25e1e20fd26047b727f0385,2024-10-05

One firm that has been investing in OpenAI is Ark Invest. Cathie Wood, ARK Invest's CEO and CIO, is betting big on AI. She says OpenAI, along with Anthropic, xAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META) are ""stealing the march"" in the space.  While many investors are concerned about when companies will start seeing returns on their AI investments, Wood is hopeful. When asked about when OpenAI will start to turn a profit, she points to the development of agentic AI, which she thinks will open the door to more profitability, given that companies will be able to charge more for it. Despite some recent executive departures at OpenAI, Wood is confident in the startup's leadership, praising both CEO Sam Altman and CFO Sarah Friar. She notes that ""what we witness in companies that are growing very quickly from startup into scaling is you need a different kind of management team."" When it comes to competition between AI firms, Wood likes it. ""Competition is good. It's going to make this space more competitive and more effective, I think, longer term,"" she says. On the possibility of a company like OpenAI going public, Wood argues ""a lot of companies are staying private longer. They just don't want to deal with the regulation in the public equity markets. And they also don't want to deal with the very short-term oriented or short-term investment time horizon of shareholders in the public equity markets."" However, she does think the public market could become more appealing with interest rates coming down and if investors were willing to stomach the longer-term time horizons some of these companies are working with.

Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets lead equity analyst of global autos, sits down with Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to dig into Tesla's (TSLA) delivery numbers and where the company stands going forward. Narayan outlines his view that Tesla’s subpar auto sales don’t actually matter, explaining that the “car business for me is less, like 5% of my [Tesla] valuation. They need to sell cars to sell [full self-driving] FSD and everything else. But I think folks are going to start looking at the bottom line more on gross profit. You're going to have regulatory credits, which surprised a lot of people last quarter. It's going to be good this quarter again and next year. And energy storage, people are finally talking about this. We saw the number that they printed today wasn't as good as last quarter, but way bigger than the run rate of last year. So I think folks are going to stop looking at the delivery numbers so carefully. And start looking at gross profit. And it's going to look pretty good.” He says the highly-anticipated robotaxi is “half of my entire valuation, as you know. I'm a big believer in the robotaxi concept. The difference, though, between this event and what they held in the Power Day a few years ago, where the stock was up quite a bit, is Power Day was more real now, whereas I think robotaxis are a little bit farther away. That's why I think it might be difficult to get crazy excited, at least a stock to react the way it will be. I think it did into it, but I do think you'll get a lot of people like me writing big reports finally with real numbers and putting it in their models. That might help. But again, this is far into the future, so I just don't know how much it's going to impact.” The long horizon for Tesla’s robotaxi isn’t a tech issue but rather a regulatory issue. “We all saw what happened with GM Cruise having to pull away and now starting to tip their toe back in. Cities are going to have to completely re-engineer themselves… It's a very human-driven thing, let's put it that way. You're making decisions all the time. And so it's going to take a while for regulators to be okay with that.” The analyst offers his perspective on the Cybertruck and the model's role in the Tesla brand. “I don't think it's a real game-changer. If anything, they're losing money on it, but it is trying to get excitement back into the brand, which maybe they lost a little compared to where they were. But really, ultimately, this is a halo car that hopefully lifts their brand.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on Wednesday, while oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) continued to rise and bitcoin (BTC-USD) experienced a sharp decline. Traders flocked to more defensive areas of the market in Tuesday's trading session after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel. Israel has vowed to respond to the attack, raising concerns about tensions in the Middle East escalating even further. Raymond James Washington policy analyst and managing director Ed Mills observes that markets have been ""shockingly resilient"" despite global unrest. ""There are a lot of unknowns ahead and Israel will absolutely respond. They cannot let hundreds of missiles going towards their country be met without a response,"" Mills states. However, he notes that the nature of Israel's response remains ""uncertain."" US private payroll numbers beat Wall Street expectations in September, according to the latest ADP report. The data shows that 143,000 jobs were added in the private sector last month, surpassing the projected 125,000 jobs — a significant increase from August's reported 99,000 jobs. Tesla (TSLA) shares are under pressure after the company reported that it delivered 462,890 vehicles during the third quarter. This figure came in slightly below Wall Street's expectation of 463,897 deliveries. William Blair group head of energy and sustainability research sector, Jed Dorsheimer, notes that the growing optimism in delivery estimates on Wall Street was closely tied to Tesla's rising stock price. Consequently, he says, ""it's not surprising to see a pullback"" now that the numbers have missed expectations. Despite this setback, Dorsheimer points out that this quarter demonstrates Tesla's stabilization ahead of ""some key catalysts"" for the business, including the upcoming robotaxi event and the Shanghai energy business. Nike (NKE) is looking for a fresh start under its incoming CEO, Elliott Hill. The footwear giant reported mixed fiscal first quarter results, withdrew its full-year sales guidance, and postponed its investor day that was originally scheduled for November. Hill will step into the role on October 14, where he will embark on a turnaround mission for the company. Baird Senior Research Analyst Jonathan Komp argues that under Hill, Nike will likely be able to improve its performance, saying, ""Generally, we expect stocks in the sector to bottom when earnings start getting less bad. We think we've seen the worst here for Nike, but it is going to take patience."" As the Federal Reserve's rate easing cycle is underway, Megan Horneman, Verdence Capital Advisors CIO, believes that investors are putting too much faith in a soft landing. She tells Yahoo Finance, ""People are just getting a little ahead of themselves as far as what strength there is in the economy."" While the labor market remains ""relatively strong,"" she has concerns about the consumer, noting that credit card debt is over $1 trillion. She adds, ""We know that inflation is coming down towards the Fed's target, but we can't forget that this has been accumulating for several years now. So this is really a strain on consumers...

And we've seen the rates coming down, that should help a little bit,” Brauer says. He explains, “We're going to need to see some confidence in the future. I think a lot of people are waiting for a rather big event about a month from now to see what happens there. So I think there's a lot of people kind of waiting on hold right now to make any big moves. And that's what you're seeing in these dropping new and used car sales activity. Hopefully, that will get turned around.” Not all automakers are feeling the pressure the same with luxury brands faring better than their standard counterparts. The analyst says, “The luxury side has done better because those consumers aren't as concerned about their financial situation.” He highlights the Korean luxury brand Genesis, owned by Hyundai (HYMTF), which hit record-high sales.

The company reported 462,890 deliveries, slightly below the Bloomberg estimate of 463,897. William Blair group head of energy and sustainability research sector Jed Dorsheimer joins Morning Brief to discuss his outlook on the automaker. Dorsheimer notes that the growing optimism in delivery estimates on Wall Street was closely tied to Tesla's rising stock price. Consequently, he says, ""it's not surprising to see a pullback"" now that the numbers have missed expectations. Despite this setback, Dorsheimer points out that this quarter demonstrates Tesla's stabilization ahead of ""some key catalysts"" for the business, including the upcoming robotaxi event and the Shanghai energy business. Importantly, Dorsheimer emphasizes the significance of Tesla's energy business and its potential impact on the company's future growth. He states, ""Our grids are stressed to the max right now and that's a global statement. And so looking at Megapack as a solution for a portion of that, that demand in our opinion could be as much as what we're seeing on the vehicle side.""

Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder and Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Doug Clinton sits down with Josh Lipton on Market Domination Overtime to discuss what the election outcome means for Musk and how his political involvement affects investors. ""It will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk,"" Clinton says, adding, ""He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction. And I think if it goes against him if Kamala Harris is elected president, I think it probably is a negative for him."" He notes that Tesla could stand to benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a green energy push. Clinton says that Musk will likely ""find some way to try to mend fences and say, 'Look, obviously, it didn't go the way that we were campaigning, but we have this agenda that actually does very much align with some of the principles of the Democratic Party.' I mean, Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world."" As an investor in Musk's companies, Clinton says, ""We try to separate [Musk's companies from his politics]. At Deepwater, we are investors in xAI, and we're big believers that there's basically four companies on Earth that have a chance to build the foundation models that power sort of everything. It's Meta (META) with Llama, it's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) [with] Gemini, OpenAI with GPT, and then xAI with Grok.

The rideshare platform posted revenue of $11.19 billion, surpassing estimates of $10.99 billion. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.20, significantly higher than the anticipated $0.45. Despite these positive metrics, Uber's stock faced pressure due to weaker-than-expected gross bookings and a reduced fourth quarter outlook. Kindred Ventures Founder and managing partner Steve Jang joins Morning Brief to provide insights into Uber's performance and future potential. ""The company is starting to show that it's not just a marketplace company but a software company,"" Jang says, highlighting Uber's profitability and continued growth opportunities. Jang emphasizes Uber's strategic positioning, pointing to potential expansion in autonomous and electric vehicles. He praises the company's cost-consciousness and ability to apply its software network across ridesharing, delivery, and freight services. ""Uber is the demand network,"" Jang states, arguing that emerging technologies like Waymo and Tesla's (TSLA) autonomous vehicles will take time to impact the market. However, Uber's global network, software, and 24/7 operations provide a competitive advantage that these companies may want to use in the future.

With Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) set to report this week, Capital Fund Management head of macro strategy Christian Dery joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the impact of the Magnificent Seven on the broader market. “These companies have gotten so large that on earnings events…you're getting these swings in market cap on the order of $2 [billion] to $400 billion,” Dery says, highlighting Nvidia (NVDA) and its impact on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) specifically. The chipmaker doesn’t report earnings until Nov. 20. As the Magnificent Seven companies report earnings, capital spending will likely be closely watched by investors as Big Tech companies invest billions into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure without a definitive timeline on AI monetization. The strategist says, “The reality is that the existing incumbents have to build out this technology because they can't risk falling behind their competitors,” but “We haven't found the killer use case just yet, and the market is going to start to be more discerning in terms of [the] path to profitability scale. They're going to focus on CapEx and projections for CapEx.” For more on how Dery navigates investing in the Magnificent Seven, watch the video above.

The senior equity research analyst sees several factors driving the market darlings higher into the end of the year, ranging from expectations about loosened regulation from the incoming Trump administration to increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by the US government. The analyst also sees the tech sector gaining by 20% through 2025.

That's why this is going to be a tech bull market that rages into next year,"" Ives explains to Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith.

Dorsheimer observes ""investor fatigue"" surrounding Tesla's latest offerings, including the Cybertruck and Models S and X. He notes that, while the Cybertruck's price is set to decrease, it remains ""a very niche market"" for that vehicle type, suggesting a limited impact on overall deliveries. He emphasizes that Tesla's success primarily stems from its more affordable offerings: the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. ""For Tesla to rebound from a volume perspective on the auto side of its business, we think it's really going to be the introduction of a Model 2 or hatchback,"" he tells Yahoo Finance.  Dorsheimer highlights ""a silver lining"" in Tesla's energy storage side and concludes, ""Tesla has a lot of different tools in its toolbox, and we'll see how it plays out.
