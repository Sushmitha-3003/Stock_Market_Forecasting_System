Goldman Sachs Senior Equity Research Analyst Eric Sheridan joins Market Domination to discuss his outlook on the digital consumer. Sheridan notes that when it comes to the digital consumer, there isn't a ""black and white"" answer regarding the health of this segment. While acknowledging that consumer spending is slowing, Sheridan doesn't believe the economy is ""hurtling towards any kind of recession in terms of the digital consumer and the digital economy."" Regarding AI return on investment, Sheridan observes that cloud computing companies are seeing the most direct returns on AI spend. However, he notes that it will take longer to see returns in the consumer landscape. ""Most consumers have the same internet habits today that they had 18-24 months ago around the time that ChatGPT exploded,"" he states. Sheridan explains that it takes time for consumers to adjust their computing habits. So while enterprises are seeing immediate returns, it is normal for consumer adoption to lag behind. Watch the video above to hear which tech stock Sheridan recommends: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) or Meta (META).

TechRadar Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff joins Market Domination to discuss this development. Ulanoff observes that the market for mixed reality headsets has proven to be ""a struggle"" for many companies. He references Apple's (AAPL) Vision Pro, noting that while the product is ""incredible,"" it likely hasn't sold the way Apple would have liked. Ulanoff points out that Qualcomm-Google's focus on smart glasses rather than a headset could potentially yield better results. As far as features, Ulanoff notes to capture consumer attention the glasses have to have two key things. First they have to be ""excellent looking,"" and secondly the display technology must allow for an ""overlaying of the world in front of you.""

Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI managing director, joins Josh Schafer and Madison Mills on Market Domination to take a look at the energy sector. Chopra says “the single largest catalyst” for independent power producers (IPPs) like Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vista Energy (VIST) is “the need for clean energy, 24/7 energy by these data centers.” The analyst says reopening dormant nuclear plants is “going to be the next big thing” in energy. He notes,” We have to be careful to balance this demand trend that we bring supply on time while also not disrupting the balance of residential customer builds. So I think that's a key challenge. But this is a good position for utilities to be in.” For investors looking to get in on the AI-driven energy boom, Chopra says he doesn’t think the utilities sector is currently overbought. “Some of these IPPs may seem expensive on earnings, but there's a tremendous amount of EPS upside… I think there's more to go.” He expects utilities to outperform the market led by the IPPs by the end of the quarter. Chopra adds that the opportunity in energy stocks is more long-term. “The reality is you build something new today, whether it's a gas plant, whether it's wind, solar storage, small modular reactors, all of these technologies are five to seven years build time… So these things are going to take some time. But they're all additive to earnings and should boost the long-term growth profile of the utility sector.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened lower on Thursday amid the latest labor market data and increasing Middle East tensions. Initial jobless claims for the week ending September 28 rose to 225,000, slightly above the estimated 221,000. Oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) are continuing to spike as tensions boil between Israel and Iran. US stock markets are experiencing a period of heightened volatility, driven by a variety of factors including Hurricane Helene, the upcoming US presidential election, and escalating Middle East tensions. The Wealth Consulting Group's chief market strategist Talley Léger acknowledges that markets have been hit by numerous events that could potentially unsettle investors, questioning, ""when are they perfectly certain?"" However, he notes that such turbulence is a common occurrence in financial markets, adding that ""through it all, the stock market has continued its inexorable march forward."" Due to this dynamic, Léger advises investors to view market dips as potential buying opportunities. The rotation out of Big Tech has become evident, with the standout ""Magnificent Seven"" (AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, GOOGL, AMZN, META, MSFT, NVDA) names no longer being the market frontrunners they once were. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza notes that the Magnificent Seven's market leadership ""hit an abrupt stop"" in mid-July, fueled by the unwinding of the yen carry trade. While Meta has been the only name to somewhat recover, Mazza believes ""it's too early to give up"" on the Magnificent Seven. Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt’s senior research analyst, outlines his bullish stance on Meta. “The growth supports the multiple… The bigger backdrop, we think, is that people are getting more comfortable with Meta’s strategic positioning. Their investments in AI have yielded improved returns on investment for marketers and better engagement from users, and they've kind of led and developed this direct marketing to kind of small- or mid-sized companies globally. This almost new niche that they've pioneered and owned.” Crockett explains. The Hang Seng (^HSI) ended the day lower after 13 straight days of gains following a wave of stimulus measures aimed at bolstering the country's struggling economy. While JPMorgan has warned investors about the risks of chasing the rally given its high valuations, KraneShares CIO Brendan Ahern argues it's still in the ""very, very early innings."" With more information about fiscal policy expected from Chinese officials, the rally could continue. He adds, ""Instead of looking through the rearview mirror, let's look through the windshield.""

Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza joins Morning Brief to discuss the dynamics of the Magnificent Seven. Mazza notes that the Magnificent Seven's market leadership ""hit an abrupt stop"" in mid-July, fueled by the unwinding of the Yen carry trade. While Meta has been the only name to somewhat recover, Mazza believes ""it's too early to give up"" on the Magnificent Seven. ""While we don't expect them to continue to see just outsized performance, it's tough to see the market continue to grind higher without their participation. I think a broadening is good, but I actually want these leaders to be able to participate at the same time,"" he explains. Regarding the Magnificent Seven as a whole, Mazza explains they were coined that name because they were all performing at the same rate and outperforming the rest of the markets with a strong lead. However as that trend has begun to waver, Mazza identifies Tesla as the most concerning among the names.

Jason Browne, Alexis Investment Partners president, joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss how recent volatility could be an opportunity to buy into tech. “We have a lot of negative news hitting simultaneous[ly] to the pullback. If we can look at those as opportunities to add to things that we may have missed out on or maybe underweight in that tends to work out well over time. The other thing to note is with tech, particularly [when] we're going into an environment that potentially is going to be continued growth but slower growth. Then names with very attractive balance sheets that are more consistent earners or earnings growers and so forth. They tend to be a place that people flock to,” Browne tells the Market Domination team. He adds, “We are seeing this last couple of months consolidation period in this very strong uptrend, as overall a positive thing. We had lightened up on growth leading into this mostly because of wanting, like many, to take advantage of the broadening leadership associated with a more sustained rally. But we've been buying the dip in tech periodically in each of these pullbacks.” The portfolio manager mentions Alexis Investment Partners “used more indirect exposure than direct buying,” with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) “that have significant weighting to these names.” He names iShares Global 100 ETF (IOO.MX) and Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) as ways to play tech. Browne notes that the ETFs were ""within the context of also adding to things like"" [real estate investment trusts] REITs and the equal-weight S&P 500 (^SPXEW). ""I was kind of buying the dip today in general, but I specifically did make sure to incorporate some of these broadly diversified funds that are heavily weighted to large-cap tech as a big chunk.” Browne also has focused on ""standouts within leading sectors."" He says ""Within technology, we own, as you might imagine, Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), in addition to owning a semiconductor ETF.""

Despite the strong showings, capital expenditures (CapEx) on artificial intelligence (AI) are spooking some investors. Bernstein internet equity research analyst Mark Shmulik tells Yahoo Finance that Amazon ""feels like kind of the name that you can put money to work in and get excited about."" Alphabet also reported a positive third quarter, but Shmulik notes ongoing legal issues — especially in the antitrust arena — for Google that could hold the company back: ""There's just a whole bunch of noise around the name that's really hard to break through."" In terms of Meta, Shmulik also thinks the socail media giant is positioned well, but that when it comes to AI spending, ""we're still waiting to see just how big that spending is going to be and over what duration we could expect the return."" Shmulik goes on to explain his Underpeform rating on Reddit (RDDT). Watch the video above to hear Shmulik's take on big tech and other internet stocks.

CFRA Equity Analyst Daniel Rich joined Catalysts to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear energy future as companies search for clean methods to power their AI data centers. ""It certainly is a setback,"" Rich tells Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills, but it's far from over. The CFRA analyst notes that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision was split, and it ""wouldn't be surprising"" for there to be a rehearing shortly.  Though the regulatory roadblock adds a bit of near-term uncertainty, Rich is still ""pretty favorable"" on Constellation Energy and its peers given the interest from Big Tech — Amazon, Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all announced investments in nuclear power. ""Whatever happens with the [FERC] decision, we think Constellation is in a pretty good spot,"" Rich says, adding that today's sell-off in shares presents a viable buying opportunity for investors. The regulatory news overshadowed Constellation Energy's robust third quarter results out Monday morning. The energy giant raised its full year adjusted operating earnings guidance after topping Wall Street's expectations for operating revenue by more than $1 billion. In the earnings release, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez lays out ""the importance of AI and the data economy to America’s economic competitiveness and national security can’t be overstated."" CFRA maintains its Buy opinion on Constellation shares, but lowered the 12-month price target by $25 to $280 per share citing the uncertainty from the FERC decision. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).

The rideshare platform posted revenue of $11.19 billion, surpassing estimates of $10.99 billion. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.20, significantly higher than the anticipated $0.45. Despite these positive metrics, Uber's stock faced pressure due to weaker-than-expected gross bookings and a reduced fourth quarter outlook. Kindred Ventures Founder and managing partner Steve Jang joins Morning Brief to provide insights into Uber's performance and future potential. ""The company is starting to show that it's not just a marketplace company but a software company,"" Jang says, highlighting Uber's profitability and continued growth opportunities. Jang emphasizes Uber's strategic positioning, pointing to potential expansion in autonomous and electric vehicles. He praises the company's cost-consciousness and ability to apply its software network across ridesharing, delivery, and freight services. ""Uber is the demand network,"" Jang states, arguing that emerging technologies like Waymo and Tesla's (TSLA) autonomous vehicles will take time to impact the market. However, Uber's global network, software, and 24/7 operations provide a competitive advantage that these companies may want to use in the future.

""It captures your attention with the content and the algorithm, and through personalization, it drives you through the funnel to get you to convert,"" Tipograph says. ""So it's the power of the entire marketing funnel that exists within TikTok. You find some of that in Meta, you find some of that in Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) but TikTok is the whole story."" Tipograph notes if the Chinese-owned app is banned, Alphabet could see the biggest gains in ad revenue, while e-commerce platforms like Amazon (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), and Walmart (WMT) could benefit from TikTok Shops' potential loss.

Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

MDB Capital president and chief market strategist Lou Basenese sits down in-studio with Seana Smith and Madison Mills for a conversation about where he expects market momentum to broaden out in the coming new year. ""The heavy concentration is the fact that if we look at the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), expectations are for their growth in earnings to accelerate significantly. So from about 4% this year to 13%,"" Basenese explains. ""So we need other names to pick up and carry the ball in 2025. And I think we're going to see that happen. The tech sector is obviously going to have the strongest growth, but we need to see everyone else participating."" Basenese goes on to comment about where bitcoin (BTC-USD), the volatility index (^VIX), and even the Federal Reserve fit into market expectations.

Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings. Ives tells investors to ""get the popcorn out"" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is ""the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating."" Ives says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company. ""Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google."" the analyst explains. Ives adds, ""Now it's going to start playing out on the consumer side ... Zuckerberg and Meta, they're one step ahead here in terms of where this is all heading.""

The race to better compete with AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA) is well underway. Enter Groq (GROQ.PVT). The company makes what it calls language processing units (LPUs). These LPUs are designed to make large language models run faster and more efficiently, unlike Nvidia GPUs that target training models. Groq’s last capital raise was in August 2024, when it raised $640 million from the likes of BlackRock (BLK) and Cisco (CSCO). The company’s valuation at the time stood at $2.8 billion, a fraction of Nvidia’s more than $3 trillion market cap. It currently clocks in at $3.5 billion, according to Yahoo Finance private markets data. At the helm of Groq is founder and CEO Jonathan Ross. While at Google (GOOG), Ross designed the custom chips that the tech giant would go on to train its AI models on. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with Ross to discuss his future plans for Groq. Ross is fresh off a trip with other key tech executives to Saudi Arabia, joining President Donald Trump in forging a deeper tech relationship with the country.
