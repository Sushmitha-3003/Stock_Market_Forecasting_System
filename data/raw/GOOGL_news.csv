Despite the strong showings, capital expenditures (CapEx) on artificial intelligence (AI) are spooking some investors. Bernstein internet equity research analyst Mark Shmulik tells Yahoo Finance that Amazon ""feels like kind of the name that you can put money to work in and get excited about."" Alphabet also reported a positive third quarter, but Shmulik notes ongoing legal issues — especially in the antitrust arena — for Google that could hold the company back: ""There's just a whole bunch of noise around the name that's really hard to break through."" In terms of Meta, Shmulik also thinks the socail media giant is positioned well, but that when it comes to AI spending, ""we're still waiting to see just how big that spending is going to be and over what duration we could expect the return."" Shmulik goes on to explain his Underpeform rating on Reddit (RDDT). Watch the video above to hear Shmulik's take on big tech and other internet stocks.

CFRA Equity Analyst Daniel Rich joined Catalysts to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear energy future as companies search for clean methods to power their AI data centers. ""It certainly is a setback,"" Rich tells Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills, but it's far from over. The CFRA analyst notes that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision was split, and it ""wouldn't be surprising"" for there to be a rehearing shortly.  Though the regulatory roadblock adds a bit of near-term uncertainty, Rich is still ""pretty favorable"" on Constellation Energy and its peers given the interest from Big Tech — Amazon, Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all announced investments in nuclear power. ""Whatever happens with the [FERC] decision, we think Constellation is in a pretty good spot,"" Rich says, adding that today's sell-off in shares presents a viable buying opportunity for investors. The regulatory news overshadowed Constellation Energy's robust third quarter results out Monday morning. The energy giant raised its full year adjusted operating earnings guidance after topping Wall Street's expectations for operating revenue by more than $1 billion. In the earnings release, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez lays out ""the importance of AI and the data economy to America’s economic competitiveness and national security can’t be overstated."" CFRA maintains its Buy opinion on Constellation shares, but lowered the 12-month price target by $25 to $280 per share citing the uncertainty from the FERC decision. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).
