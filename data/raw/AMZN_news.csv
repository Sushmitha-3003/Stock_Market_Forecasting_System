The decision comes as Big Tech companies have turned to nuclear energy to power their artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, stoking some worries about the recent rally in nuclear energy stocks. ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear push. ""Ultimately, we think the Federal Energy Regulatory [Commission] decision is a short-term setback for generators that wish to co-locate their load or co-locate their power with a data center and also a setback for the data center developers. But the order may not represent a long-term risk. It's more that FERC may have punted or didn't want to set a precedent about co-location."" Fox outlines, ""Regulators are concerned about three things. They're concerned about reliability, taking in existing large nuclear power plants offline. Does that create reliability risks? They're also concerned about ratepayers. Do existing ratepayers have to pay some unfair portion of the cost of upgrading the grid to accommodate a new data center? And then also the third concern is policy. Does the influx of new data centers create a concern about being able to meet state or local decarbonization policies?""

Despite the strong showings, capital expenditures (CapEx) on artificial intelligence (AI) are spooking some investors. Bernstein internet equity research analyst Mark Shmulik tells Yahoo Finance that Amazon ""feels like kind of the name that you can put money to work in and get excited about."" Alphabet also reported a positive third quarter, but Shmulik notes ongoing legal issues — especially in the antitrust arena — for Google that could hold the company back: ""There's just a whole bunch of noise around the name that's really hard to break through."" In terms of Meta, Shmulik also thinks the socail media giant is positioned well, but that when it comes to AI spending, ""we're still waiting to see just how big that spending is going to be and over what duration we could expect the return."" Shmulik goes on to explain his Underpeform rating on Reddit (RDDT). Watch the video above to hear Shmulik's take on big tech and other internet stocks.

CFRA Equity Analyst Daniel Rich joined Catalysts to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear energy future as companies search for clean methods to power their AI data centers. ""It certainly is a setback,"" Rich tells Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills, but it's far from over. The CFRA analyst notes that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision was split, and it ""wouldn't be surprising"" for there to be a rehearing shortly.  Though the regulatory roadblock adds a bit of near-term uncertainty, Rich is still ""pretty favorable"" on Constellation Energy and its peers given the interest from Big Tech — Amazon, Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all announced investments in nuclear power. ""Whatever happens with the [FERC] decision, we think Constellation is in a pretty good spot,"" Rich says, adding that today's sell-off in shares presents a viable buying opportunity for investors. The regulatory news overshadowed Constellation Energy's robust third quarter results out Monday morning. The energy giant raised its full year adjusted operating earnings guidance after topping Wall Street's expectations for operating revenue by more than $1 billion. In the earnings release, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez lays out ""the importance of AI and the data economy to America’s economic competitiveness and national security can’t be overstated."" CFRA maintains its Buy opinion on Constellation shares, but lowered the 12-month price target by $25 to $280 per share citing the uncertainty from the FERC decision. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).

Jones emphasizes that Amazon's AI investments are critical to maintaining its competitive edge. ""AI is this massive, massive opportunity. We're only a year or so into the opportunity, so we're probably looking at a very long runway of spend,"" he tells Yahoo Finance.

The senior equity research analyst sees several factors driving the market darlings higher into the end of the year, ranging from expectations about loosened regulation from the incoming Trump administration to increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by the US government. The analyst also sees the tech sector gaining by 20% through 2025. ""It's about the multiplier — for every dollar spent on Nvidia chip, there's an $8 to $10 multiplier across tech, across software, infrastructure, cybersecurity. That's why this is going to be a tech bull market that rages into next year,"" Ives explains to Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith. ""Because now it's about the second [or] fourth-derivative. Because now software they're they're on the dance floor at the AI party, they're no longer waiting behind the velvet rope. And now other tech players are trying to get in cybersecurity infrastructure."" Ives also comments on Palantir's (PLTR) position in the so-called AI revolution, speculating that the company has the potential to the next Oracle (ORCL).

AWS, Amazon's cloud business, unveiled several updates to its data center infrastructure to ensure it can meet customers' AI needs. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley sits down with AWS vice president of infrastructure Prasad Kalyanaraman to discuss the announcements and what investors need to know about AWS' AI efforts. Kalyanaraman outlines four key focus areas of AWS' work: design simplification, power, cooling, and capacity. ""We've done a ton of improvements in terms of simplification of our electrical and mechanical design that will improve the availability for our customers even more,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. ""The second part of it is that generative AI requires a meaningful amount of power for these racks and for these chips, and we've been innovating on our power delivery design to these servers as well."" ""[The] third part is our cooling design,"" the AWS vice president says, adding, ""We've innovated in such a way that we can retrofit our existing data centers for liquid cooling as well as air cooling. ""Finally, our improvements in mechanical and electrical efficiency, to the tune of about 40% to 46% or so, has actually improved the amount of capacity we can deliver for our customers in the exact same data center."" Ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) official launch of its new AI chip, Blackwell, Kalyanaraman talks about AWS' ongoing partnership with Nvidia and how the latest chip fits into the company's AI push. ""The latest set of chips from Nvidia, which are the Blackwell processors, do require liquid cooling, and so we've been innovating in a way such that we can run liquid cooling infrastructure in addition to air cooling infrastructure.""

Mukunda asserts that companies are being pragmatic in their support for Trump, pointing out Trump's historical willingness to use federal government power against those he perceives as political enemies or threats. He references Trump's previous conflicts with Jeff Bezos during his first term, when Trump targeted Bezos over his ownership of the Washington Post. Mukunda observes, ""Trump is very transactional, and these companies are making a transaction."" However, he warns, ""When you have said 'I will pay up if you threaten me,' the incentive you have created is to keep threatening you in order to get more payouts,"" adding that these companies ""will learn the hard way.""

However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

The Biden administration's ""main approach to artificial intelligence was to say, 'This is an area where we ought to tread carefully, put up guardrails, and focus on safety,'"" Kovacevic says.

Jaggi emphasizes the remarkable resilience of US consumer spending. ""I think it really says a lot about the fact that, at the end of the day, this consumer economy keeps finding ways to engage with the consumer,"" he observes. However, Jaggi points out a shift in shopping patterns: ""We have become a value-oriented consumer society."" Retailers like Ross (ROST), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT) are experiencing consistent foot traffic as shoppers seek bargains. This value-hunting extends online, with Jaggi noting that ""the US consumer continues to find ways to find the best bang for the dollar."" Looking ahead to 2025, Jaggi expresses optimism about the department store sector. He views Nordstrom's (JWN) announcement to go private as ""great news,"" describing the retailer as ""the gold standard"" and suggesting the move will enable better focus on long-term growth strategies.
