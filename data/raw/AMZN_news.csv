Goldman Sachs Senior Equity Research Analyst Eric Sheridan joins Market Domination to discuss his outlook on the digital consumer. Sheridan notes that when it comes to the digital consumer, there isn't a ""black and white"" answer regarding the health of this segment. While acknowledging that consumer spending is slowing, Sheridan doesn't believe the economy is ""hurtling towards any kind of recession in terms of the digital consumer and the digital economy."" Regarding AI return on investment, Sheridan observes that cloud computing companies are seeing the most direct returns on AI spend. However, he notes that it will take longer to see returns in the consumer landscape. ""Most consumers have the same internet habits today that they had 18-24 months ago around the time that ChatGPT exploded,"" he states. Sheridan explains that it takes time for consumers to adjust their computing habits. So while enterprises are seeing immediate returns, it is normal for consumer adoption to lag behind. Watch the video above to hear which tech stock Sheridan recommends: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) or Meta (META).

This deal could see the reopening of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, and according to Jeffries, Microsoft could be paying $112 per megawatt hour, one of the higher estimates across the Street. Jefferies analyst Paul Zimbardo joins Catalysts to discuss the deal between Constellation Energy and Microsoft, and whether the presidential election could weigh on its completion. ""It was a very positive update for Constellation. The struggle on the stock is it's pricing in a lot. When we go through plant by plant, the fundamentals, the market is assuming that roughly 50% are a little bit more than 50% of their portfolio will contract at these very high prices... the $100+ per megawatt hour. So expectations are very high,"" Zimbardo says of the news. Despite regulatory hurdles ahead, if the plan goes through, Zimbardo explains it could be a ""game changer"" for both Constellation and the broader energy sector. ""Microsoft is paying roughly double what market power costs, around $55 a megawatt hour. So this was a significant update, paying a much larger premium than even the prior transaction with Amazon (AMZN) and a different nuclear reactor, Susquehanna, owned by Talen (TLN),"" he explains. Zimbardo adds, ""So the way we frame it, if, as we call it, Constellation runs the table and is able to secure all their capacity, our upside case, the stock can easily double from here. But there's a lot of questions and execution that has to go in it."" As the presidential election lies just over a month away, he does not expect the outcome to weigh too much on the deal. He notes that Constellation is the largest US nuclear owner-operator and they have a good track record both operationally and financially. ""They've been working on this project for over a year, so we feel pretty comfortable that they will be able to execute on this,"" he adds. Zimbaro concludes, ""Nuclear has become increasingly bipartisan, clean energy as well as the strong union jobs. So we think that the strong narrative towards nuclear will hold even regardless of the election outcome.""

The decision comes as Big Tech companies have turned to nuclear energy to power their artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, stoking some worries about the recent rally in nuclear energy stocks. ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear push. ""Ultimately, we think the Federal Energy Regulatory [Commission] decision is a short-term setback for generators that wish to co-locate their load or co-locate their power with a data center and also a setback for the data center developers. But the order may not represent a long-term risk. It's more that FERC may have punted or didn't want to set a precedent about co-location."" Fox outlines, ""Regulators are concerned about three things. They're concerned about reliability, taking in existing large nuclear power plants offline. Does that create reliability risks? They're also concerned about ratepayers. Do existing ratepayers have to pay some unfair portion of the cost of upgrading the grid to accommodate a new data center? And then also the third concern is policy. Does the influx of new data centers create a concern about being able to meet state or local decarbonization policies?""

Mahoney tells retail investors, ""Don't get involved in this. You know there's a lot of emotion, and I know it's easy for me to say that, but the last thing you want to do is get whipsawed out of your position ... Our Founding Fathers kind of figured this out, that we have a balance of power and after this election, we're still going to have a balance of power."" He adds there are ""so many tailwinds,"" including the Federal Reserve meeting on Thursday, Big Tech companies' artificial intelligence (AI) spending, and strong earnings. ""You have a lot of bears [that have] been on the sidelines. They're going to have to commit capital toward the end of the year. Otherwise, the index is going to be way ahead of them. So again, I just say that sometimes we lose sight. We have to come back [and] see where we are, and there's a really strong tailwind despite who wins."" He highlights, ""Our favorites are still the market leaders"" like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). ""That's the way we've been playing this right now is some of your best stocks you like with the added volatility. Make volatility your friend, not your foe. And by doing that is actually try to buy some stock. Your favorite stocks below the market which is trading right now.""

Despite the strong showings, capital expenditures (CapEx) on artificial intelligence (AI) are spooking some investors. Bernstein internet equity research analyst Mark Shmulik tells Yahoo Finance that Amazon ""feels like kind of the name that you can put money to work in and get excited about."" Alphabet also reported a positive third quarter, but Shmulik notes ongoing legal issues — especially in the antitrust arena — for Google that could hold the company back: ""There's just a whole bunch of noise around the name that's really hard to break through."" In terms of Meta, Shmulik also thinks the socail media giant is positioned well, but that when it comes to AI spending, ""we're still waiting to see just how big that spending is going to be and over what duration we could expect the return."" Shmulik goes on to explain his Underpeform rating on Reddit (RDDT). Watch the video above to hear Shmulik's take on big tech and other internet stocks.

CFRA Equity Analyst Daniel Rich joined Catalysts to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear energy future as companies search for clean methods to power their AI data centers. ""It certainly is a setback,"" Rich tells Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills, but it's far from over. The CFRA analyst notes that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision was split, and it ""wouldn't be surprising"" for there to be a rehearing shortly.  Though the regulatory roadblock adds a bit of near-term uncertainty, Rich is still ""pretty favorable"" on Constellation Energy and its peers given the interest from Big Tech — Amazon, Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all announced investments in nuclear power. ""Whatever happens with the [FERC] decision, we think Constellation is in a pretty good spot,"" Rich says, adding that today's sell-off in shares presents a viable buying opportunity for investors. The regulatory news overshadowed Constellation Energy's robust third quarter results out Monday morning. The energy giant raised its full year adjusted operating earnings guidance after topping Wall Street's expectations for operating revenue by more than $1 billion. In the earnings release, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez lays out ""the importance of AI and the data economy to America’s economic competitiveness and national security can’t be overstated."" CFRA maintains its Buy opinion on Constellation shares, but lowered the 12-month price target by $25 to $280 per share citing the uncertainty from the FERC decision. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).

One key metric investors were closely watching is the company's capital expenditures, particularly those related to AI investments. Citizens JMP Equity Research Analyst Nick Jones breaks down the significance of Amazon's massive tech spending on Morning Brief. Jones emphasizes that Amazon's AI investments are critical to maintaining its competitive edge. ""AI is this massive, massive opportunity. We're only a year or so into the opportunity, so we're probably looking at a very long runway of spend,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. The company plans to invest $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2024, and in 2025 ""they'll likely spend more."" Despite these substantial investments, Jones notes Amazon maintains strong operating income margins, which he sees as a key stock performance indicator. ""Amazon's a dominant cloud player. They're going to want to be dominant in AI. They need to keep spending,"" Jones adds, highlighting what he sees as a ""multi-decade runway"" for the company's artificial intelligence strategy.

The analyst also sees the tech sector gaining by 20% through 2025.

That's why this is going to be a tech bull market that rages into next year,"" Ives explains to Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith.

AWS, Amazon's cloud business, unveiled several updates to its data center infrastructure to ensure it can meet customers' AI needs. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley sits down with AWS vice president of infrastructure Prasad Kalyanaraman to discuss the announcements and what investors need to know about AWS' AI efforts. Kalyanaraman outlines four key focus areas of AWS' work: design simplification, power, cooling, and capacity. ""We've done a ton of improvements in terms of simplification of our electrical and mechanical design that will improve the availability for our customers even more,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. ""The second part of it is that generative AI requires a meaningful amount of power for these racks and for these chips, and we've been innovating on our power delivery design to these servers as well."" ""[The] third part is our cooling design,"" the AWS vice president says, adding, ""We've innovated in such a way that we can retrofit our existing data centers for liquid cooling as well as air cooling. ""Finally, our improvements in mechanical and electrical efficiency, to the tune of about 40% to 46% or so, has actually improved the amount of capacity we can deliver for our customers in the exact same data center."" Ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) official launch of its new AI chip, Blackwell, Kalyanaraman talks about AWS' ongoing partnership with Nvidia and how the latest chip fits into the company's AI push. ""The latest set of chips from Nvidia, which are the Blackwell processors, do require liquid cooling, and so we've been innovating in a way such that we can run liquid cooling infrastructure in addition to air cooling infrastructure.""

He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

MDB Capital president and chief market strategist Lou Basenese sits down in-studio with Seana Smith and Madison Mills for a conversation about where he expects market momentum to broaden out in the coming new year.

JLL Americas President of Retail Naveen Jaggi joins Catalysts to analyze what this statistic reveals about consumer behavior and the broader retail sector. Jaggi emphasizes the remarkable resilience of US consumer spending. ""I think it really says a lot about the fact that, at the end of the day, this consumer economy keeps finding ways to engage with the consumer,"" he observes. However, Jaggi points out a shift in shopping patterns: ""We have become a value-oriented consumer society."" Retailers like Ross (ROST), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT) are experiencing consistent foot traffic as shoppers seek bargains. This value-hunting extends online, with Jaggi noting that ""the US consumer continues to find ways to find the best bang for the dollar."" Looking ahead to 2025, Jaggi expresses optimism about the department store sector. He views Nordstrom's (JWN) announcement to go private as ""great news,"" describing the retailer as ""the gold standard"" and suggesting the move will enable better focus on long-term growth strategies. ""Retail requires a long-term mindset,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. ""It does not require a quarter-to-quarter mindset only.""

His top pick for 2025 and large-cap stocks, in fact, is rideshare giant Uber Technologies (UBER). ""When we looked at Uber we see a couple of things: Number one, an outsized risk reward. Our fair value is $96... with we believe not much downside. The stock also has gotten caught up in a lot of debates in the last few months... [including] the debate around Waymo and what will happen to autonomous vehicles over the next three, five, seven, ten years,"" Sheridan tells Catalyst hosts Seana Smith and Brian Sozzi. Sheridan also shares his favorable outlook on Magnificent Seven players Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META). “Amazon, among those three, probably has the most upside. We believe Amazon still has exposure to the widest collection of the secular themes you want exposure to in the digital economy,” Sheridan says. “Media consumption habits, shopping, cloud computing, AI — these are all themes you want a lot of exposure to.""
